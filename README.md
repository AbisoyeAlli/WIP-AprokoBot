# AprokoBot
a chatbot built with js. Its an attempt to mirror small talks, its a WIP and will be built upon when I get the chance to.

Aproko asks simple questions like

```
"Hello there, I'm Aproko. What's your name?",
"Where are you from?",
"How old are you?",
"What tech stack is your favourite?",
"It was nice talking with you. Till next time! Hopefully Abisoye will find time to make me more intelligent"
   
```

and gives close-to-human responses.
